// Line 7: Mixin is a group of methods that sits on one object (ReactFire) that gets copied over to another object, in this case, line 9
// So any methods that are on ReactFire, copy paste them over to our component

// Line 8: This makes a news instance of firebase, which will make a connection and requests to our online DB, and we tell it where to exactly look for its data

// It's going to look for it's data at the application url + /items
// /items is going to be a nested route of where our data is going to be stored

// bindAsObject: method given to us by reactfire, which is the bridge between firebase and react,
